#ProgrammiconsA set of programming language icons I collected. For practicality, I've made an icon font with the invaluable help of [IconMoon](https://icomoon.io/app/#/select).The logos may be property of copyright holders. Their appearance doesn't mean their company's endorsement to Programmicons, nor vice-versa.If you wish an icon currently unavailable, please open an issue.
